# h3ron-h3-sys

[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/h3ron-h3-sys.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/h3ron-h3-sys) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/h3ron-h3-sys/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/h3ron-h3-sys)

bindgen-generated [rust](https://rust-lang.org) bindings for [H3](https://uber.github.io/h3)

[Changelog](CHANGES.md)

These bindings are basically just the autogenerated bindings emitted by [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen). The bindings
compile using the included (referenced via a git submodule) H3 source code. H3 will be statically linked into the binary, so there is
no need to install a system-wide libh3.
