# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

After version 0.12 the version numbers from the individual crates are decoupled from each other as releases are now
done without github actions and without having to coordinate the release process with the `h3ronpy`
python extension.

See the individual changelog files:

* [h3ron](h3ron/CHANGES.md)
* [h3ron-h3-sys](h3ron-h3-sys/CHANGES.md)
* [h3ron-ndarray](h3ron-ndarray/CHANGES.md)
* [h3ron-graph](h3ron-graph/CHANGES.md)
* [h3ron-polars](h3ron-polars/CHANGES.md)
