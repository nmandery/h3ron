[Changelog](CHANGES.md)

## Maintenance status

In january 2023 the [h3o library](https://github.com/HydroniumLabs/h3o) - a port of H3 to rust - has been released. This brings many benefits including type safety, compilation to WASM and performance improvements
(example: [issue comparing raster to h3 conversion](https://github.com/nmandery/rasterh3/issues/1)).

As a result this library will most certainly only receive dependency upgrades in the future.
